# Backend Auth Assignment 

This project is a **Backend Authentication System** built using **ASP.NET Core (.NET 8)** with **OTP-based login**, **JWT authentication**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Swagger UI**.

The implementation follows the trial assignment specifications and focuses on clean backend design, authentication flow, security basics, and documentation.

##  Authentication Flow

### 1 Request OTP
**POST** `/auth/request-otp`

```json
{
  "phoneNumber": "9999999999"
}


 OTP is generated and stored securely (hashed).

2️⃣ Verify OTP

POST /auth/verify-otp

{
  "phoneNumber": "9999999999",
  "otp": "123456"
}


 On success, returns:

accessToken

refreshToken

isBasicRegistrationComplete

3️⃣ Refresh Access Token

POST /auth/refresh

{
  "refreshToken": "<refresh_token>"
}

4️⃣ Logout

POST /auth/logout

{
  "refreshToken": "<refresh_token>"
}

 User APIs
 Basic Registration (Protected)

POST /user/register/basic

Authorization Header

Bearer <access_token>


Request Body

{
  "fullName": "Rohith Marupaka",
  "dateOfBirth": "2004-09-11",
  "email": "de@gmail.com",
  "location": {
    "city": "Hyderabad",
    "state": "Telangana",
    "country": "India"
  }
}


 Marks basic registration as complete.

 Get Current User (Protected + Policy)

GET /user/me

 Requires:

Valid JWT token

Basic registration completed

 Authorization & Policy

JWT authentication using Bearer tokens

Custom authorization policy: RegistrationComplete

/user/me endpoint is accessible only after basic registration is completed

⏱ OTP Rate Limiting

To prevent OTP abuse, rate limiting is implemented at the database level.

Limits

Hourly Limit: Max 3 OTP requests per phone number per hour

Daily Limit: Max 10 OTP requests per phone number in a rolling 24-hour window

Behavior

OTP requests beyond limits are blocked

Clear error messages are returned

Rate limit counters reset automatically based on time window

Each OTP request stores:

Phone number

Timestamp

Status (OK, BLOCKED_HOURLY, BLOCKED_DAILY)

 OTP Delivery (Mocked)

For this assignment, OTP delivery is mocked.

OTPs are not sent via SMS

Generated OTPs are logged to the application console/terminal

This avoids external SMS integrations while preserving OTP flow logic

 During testing, check the server console output to retrieve the OTP.

 ###  OTP Delivery (Mocked)

For this assignment, OTP delivery is mocked.

- OTPs are NOT sent via SMS.
- Generated OTPs are logged to the application console / terminal.
- This avoids external SMS integrations while preserving OTP flow logic.

 During testing, retrieve the OTP from the server console output.

#Migrations#

 Database schema is managed using Entity Framework Core migrations.

 Swagger Usage

Open Swagger UI

Swagger will be available at:
http://localhost:<port>/swagger

Call /auth/verify-otp to get accessToken

Click Authorize ()

Enter:

Bearer <access_token>


Test protected APIs

Note: Swagger auto-generates request templates.
For fields like location, the request body must be manually edited to provide a valid JSON object.

 Configuration

appsettings.json
